## Overview

Bones³, pronounced *Bones Cubed*, is a voxel based world manipulation and data storage plugin for [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy). It is designed to store data in an infinite and expandable storage grid in a manner that is useful for both writing ECS-compatible game logic and world management.

### Goals

While this project is easily capable of being used as a foundation for a voxel game engine, that is not it's sole purpose. This project aims for a more general purpose data storage and world generation system, to allow for a wider variety of projects with many art styles and game play mechanics.

## Installation
This crate can be installed using:
```
cargo add bevy_bones3
```
